After compiling the code, make will place the executable binary into the 'bin' folder.
    $ cd ./bin
To execute the server
    $ ./server -l 127.0.0.1:20000 -t 30 -a 127.0.0.1:20001
    Arguments:
        -l: listening address of TCP server
        -t: close the connection if there is no incoming message over this time in second
        -a: listening address of HTTP admin server
To execute the benchmark test client
    $ ./client -d 127.0.0.1:20000 -a 2
    Arguments:
        -l: listening address of TCP server
        -a: amount of the test client

The way to test the server with netcat
